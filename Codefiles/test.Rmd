### **Introduction**
This workshop will (eventually!) use UK Census data (from 2021) for the City of Birmingham located on the NONMIS data portal. This website  stores a large number of sources of data within the UK (employment, economic, census and so on). You can access this for yourself using this website link:

https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ 

To ease you into the process I have download a run of datasets from the Census of 2021. The spatial grain size of the data is at the Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) level. Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) are made up of groups of Output Areas (OAs), usually four or five. They comprise between 400 and 1,200 households and have a usually resident population between 1,000 and 3,000 persons. They were first created following the 2001 and they may be modified slightly after each census. Figure 1 (below) shows the Middle Super Output Areas. These are displayed for visual clarity, each one of these (and there are 132 of them) has 4-5 LSOAs embedded within it. **Birmingham has 639 LSOAs with an average population size of 1,680 residents per LSOA**.

The next few workshops in this module will these data as a case study. As the module progresses we will use datasets provided by human geography colleagues. The data are stored in a zipfile and downloadable using the following link from my github repository:

(Jon to add in the link)

Download it to a place on your hard disk or shared network drive, OneDrive or some other suitable place. Double click on the zip file and uncompress the data.

The aim of this first class is to get introduce you to R and how it works within RStudio.

In it we will:

1. Work with the Console window to carry out some basic R tasks to familarise with you the software and coding in general.
2. Download the census from my github repository.
3. Load the data into R using RStudio.
4. View the raw data in R amnd modify it.
5. Subset data in R.
6. Merge data in R.

### About R and RStudio 
The statistics and programming language we will be using is called R. It has become an industry standard (along with Python) for interrogating geographical and environmental data. Unlike 'off the shelf' software such as Excel or SPSS, the user has to type commands to get it to execute tasks such as loading in a dataset or performing a calculation. The strength of this approach is that it creates a document, or script, that provides a record of what you have done for everyone to see. It also provide a document that can be reused enabling the straightforward repetition of tasks that create the same result!

It was designed in 1990s for statistics and the generation of publication quality graphics, which can be easily modified and tweaked by making slight changes to the script. Command-line computing like this can be off-putting at first as it is easy to make mistakes that aren’t always obvious to detect. But it is worth sticking with because:

- It is an industry standard with a large user base.
- It’s free and cross-platform so runs on Windows, Mac-OS and Unix.
- It is highly customisable with a large number of libraries (‘or packages’) supporting multilevel and longitudinal regression, and mapping, spatial statistics, spatial regression and geostatistics to name a few methods.

R can be downloaded from https://www.r-project.org/. If it is not on your computer already please review the pre-session module on the CANVAS website for gudiance. It is available on our university computer cluster accessible via your AppsAnywhere. There is a shortcut to this on the desktop of all PCs. While it is possible to conduct analysis on R directly, we will run it via Rstudio which provides a user-friendly graphical user interface. After downloading R, Rstudio can be obtained for free from https://www.rstudio.com/.

To open R click on the start menu and open RStudio. You should see a screen resembling the image below (Figure 2). The screen is separated into 4 windows:
- The **scripting window** (top left). This is where you open and edit your scripts (or code files).
- The **console window** (bottom left). This is where R lists the commands you have entered and the results of those commands (or at least some of them).
- The **environment windows** - or if you like R's brain. This window shows the objects held in memory by the system (e.g. datafiles, vectors and so on), as well a history of things you've done, the connections you have open and lastly some tutorial resources.
- The **output/input** window. This shows many things but the most important are the packages you have in the system, the files you are viewing (i.e. where you working directory is), the plots/graphics you might create and help options.

![Figure 2: RStudio screen windows](/Users/jonsadler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofBirmingham/Teaching-materials/COURSES/4TH_YR/LM 40222 Quantitative methods/Images/RStudio Screen Grab.png)
We are going to start by setting the ***working directory**. This is so R knows where to open and save files to. It is recommended that you set the working directory to an appropriate space in your computers work space. To start with, make it the directory where you have stored the unzipped data.

To set the working directory, go to the **Session** option from the top bar of RStudio, click on **Set Working Directory** then **Choose Directory** and use the search window to click through to your directory and select **Open**. 

Alternatively, you can type in the address of the working directory manually using the setwd() function as demonstrated below. This requires you to type in the full address of where your data are stored. **Pay attention to the double quotes around the path address**. The code for this is:

Where, **setwd()** is the **function call**, and
**"/Users/jonsadler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofBirmingham/Teaching-materials/COURSES/4TH_YR/LM 40222 Quantitative methods"** is the **path**.

```{r}
setwd("/Users/jonsadler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofBirmingham/Teaching-materials/COURSES/4TH_YR/LM 40222 Quantitative methods")
```

If you want to know where your working directory currently is then use the **getwd()** function. R will return the disk address where it is looking.

```{r}
getwd()
```

If you want to see what files are in your working directly to copy a filename then either click on the **Files** tab on the bottom right window or use the **list.files()** function.
```{r}
list.files()
```
####  Loading some packages into the system
The base installation of R has a lot of packages loaded as default. They sit in the toolbox available for instant use. But some functions are only available in different packages that are not in the base R installation. View each package as a run of tools that do things that aren't in the base toolbox. This module will use the **Tidyverse** package for many basic tasks; it includes tools for data manipulation/wrangling, creating graphics, dealing with dates and lots of other things. It was created by Hadley Wickham  and you can read about it here:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/paper.html

and here: 

https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10

Here is the documentation/manual related to the package:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/tidyverse.pdf

To use packages you must first install them. You can do this by clicking on **packages** on the bottom right window, selecting **install** and searching for the package and installing it. Or if know know the name of the package, you can hard wire the installing using the function install.packages():
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse") # Note the use of quotes
```
Remember the packages are tools in a toolbox; to use them after you have installed them you need to take them tool out of the box. The function that does this is called **library()**.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # this loads multiple packages/libraries
```
R will generally manages the conflicts between packages that have functions with the same names but you can tell R use a function from a particular package using the package name, then two colons, and finally the function name. For example:

dplyr::filter().

*Where*, **dplyr** is the package, **::** links the package to the function **filter()**.

#### Your first code / script file
We are going to create a new code file so you can progress through the workshop. The code commands are listed in the html file outlining the workshop activities and **highlighted in square boxes**. To make a new file click on the green cross at the top left of the window -> select 'Script file' from the dropdown list. A new file called **untitled** will be added to the tabs. **Simply copy the text from the boxes and drop it into the scripting window**. Use this area as your workspace rather than typing directly into the console window (bottom left). Change the text below to fit your filename and add today's date. 
```{r}
# Filename: add in your filemane 
# Date: Add a date so you can track changes
```
The **#** symbol tells R that is is a comment so it is not run as a line of code. We use comments to aid script interpretation for users and to as an *aide memoire* for us. It is amazing what we forget when moving on from a piece of coding. 

To run a line of code hold **control Ctrl** and enter on your keyboard (**command and enter** on a mac). You can also highlight blocks of code and do the same. You can also select the line (or block of code) you wish to run and click 'Run' at the top of the scripting window. 

**NOTE: The code is sequential so start at the top and work down. If you miss bits of code it will error and you will get confused and likely frustrated.**

#### Coding Basics
R has a **steep learning curve**, but the benefits of using it are well worth the effort. Take your time and think what the code is doing as you use it. As Wickham *et al*. (2023) note "*Frustration is natural when you start programming in R because it is such a stickler for punctuation, and even one character out of place can cause it to complain. But while you should expect to be a little frustrated, take comfort in that this experience is typical and temporary: it happens to everyone, and the only way to get over it is to keep trying*"

The best way to learn R is to take the basic code provided in the workshops and experiment with changing parameters - such as point type in a graph, line thickness or point colour - ***You cannot break it! Everything is fixable***. Make lots of notes as you go along and if you are getting really frustrated take a break! In many ways this is like learning a language; a little practice more frequently is a good strategy.

R operates by taking instructions, running functions and adding the outcomes of those functions into **objects**. The objects are generated by using the assignment operator:

#### <-

This 'pipes' the outcome of a piece of code into an *object*. 

For example, try the following (copy the text from the box below and paste it into your code file, below the filename and data comment lines):

```{r}
Tutorname <- "Jon" # note the quotes. These tell R it is a string.
```

When you run the code it takes the string **Jon** and adds it to an object called **Tutorname**. This object is then stored in the **Environment** window (top right) (Figure 3).

![Figure 3](/Users/jonsadler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofBirmingham/Teaching-materials/COURSES/4TH_YR/LM 40222 Quantitative methods/Images/Object_exampleRStudio.png)

If you just type "Jon" and run that code, it will repeat the name in console window (bottom left window).

```{r}
"Jon"  
```
All R statements where you create objects, assignment statements, have the same form:

**object_name <- value**
When reading that code, say “object name gets value” in your head. You will make lots of assignments, and typing <- repetitively is a pain to type. You can save time with RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Press **Alt** and the **-** (the minus sign) in sequence. This is **Option** plus **-** (the minus sign) on a Mac.

Let's explore some more...
R will do lots of things. It will act like a huge calculator running mathematical calculations

```{r}
1/1000*25 # see the response in the console window (bottom left)
```
or 

```{r}
tan(pi*100) # or
10+20+30 # or 
```
As we have seen above you can add the outcomes of these calculations to an **object**. Keep and eye on the **Environment** window as you run the code. This is useful if you want to use the outcome many times.

```{r}
x <- 8 * 9
```
Notice it doesn't show the content of the **object** in the console window but it does store as an **object** in the computer memory or R's **Environment** (see top right window).

If you want to know whats in the object then type the object name and run the line of code.
```{r}
x
```
And it gives you the answer in the console (bottom left window).

You can combine multiple elements into a vector with the **c()** function (literally means 'concatenate' or 'add together'):

```{r}
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13) # adds primes from zero to 13 into a vector
```

And basic arithmetic on vectors is applied to every element of of the vector. So here each prime in the sequence is multiplied by 2 and the and returned to the same object. 
```{r}
primes * 2
```

**NOTE R overwrites the previous object with no warnings as that is what you told it to do!**: If want to retain the first object then give the new one a different name!

Let's create some vectors related to the different heights of males and females. Google tells me that on average women are shorter than men. In the USA in 2018 the average height for adult women was 160 cm, whereas for men it was ~ 176 cm. 

```{r}
female <- c(158, 152, 160, 166, 170, 161, 162, 155, 160, 161) # 10 women heights in cm
male <- c(180, 175, 173, 177, 170, 183, 178, 179, 181, 188) # 10 male heights in cm
```

Once we have data stored in this way we can use statistical functions to look at it.

We can compute averages or the mean height of each.
```{r}
avM <- mean(male)
avF <- mean(female)
avM
avF
```

We can find the tallest in each group.
```{r}
tallM <- max(male)
tallF <- max(female)
tallM
tallF
```
#### <span style="color:red;">TASK 1: What do you think the function to find the smallest male and females might be? [~ 1 min]</span>

We can calculate how variable they are using the **standard deviation sd()** function.

```{r}
sd(male)
sd(female) # notice we haven't created objects so the values are returned to the console window and not stored.
```
R has very many statistical functions and they often group common tasks. So the **summary()** function generates a run of basic statistical metrics for the males.

```{r}
summary(male) #look at the console to see the output
```
#### <span style="color:red;">TASK 1. Repeat this for the females [~ 1 mins]</span>
Now we have the heights of females and males we might want to compare the statistics. We can do this by creating a dataframe using the heights of females and males and apply the same **summary()** function to our dataframe. We start by using the dplyr function **data_frame()** to combined the two vectors into on dataframe called **df**. 
```{r}
df <- dplyr::data_frame(male,female) # notice we are pointing to the package and function here using ::
df # this shows the data in our dataframe
```
Now we can compare them using the **summary()** function. 
```{r}
summary(df)
```
It makes much more sense to use graphics and others statistics (e.g. means tests) to do this sort of comparison. We will pick up on these themes as the module progresses, but right now, lets conclude this session by seeing how to import datasets that already exist in digital forms into R. 

#### Loading data and data formatting in R
One of R’s great strengths is its ability to load in data in many different formats. Comma Separated Value (CSV) files are often a preferred choice for data due to their small file sizes and simplicity, but R can handle tab delineated, xls, SPSS and a number of other data formats. CSVs are a simple means of storing data so that it can be easily read and written on a computer. They are plain text with the fields of data separated by commas (you can observe this if you open a CSV in notepad or some other textfile program). We are going to open four different datasets from the Census database. 

We can read CSVs into R using the read_csv() function as demonstrated below. This requires us to identify the file location within our workspace, and also assign an object name for our data in R. We will return to the datasets you downloaded and unzipped. **Make sure your working directory is pointing to the directory where you unzipped the datafiles**.

I am resetting mine to the right place. I am doing it manually as show above. The copying the code from the console window showing the path and adding in the name of the csv file.

```{r}
# loads a csv, remember to correctly input the file location within your working directory or point to the directory where you data are stored.

Ethnicity <- read_csv("/Users/jonsadler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofBirmingham/Teaching-materials/COURSES/4TH_YR/LM 40222 Quantitative methods/Data/Birmingham Census 2021 MSOA/Bham_C2021_TS021Ethnic group.csv")
