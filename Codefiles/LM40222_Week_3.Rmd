title: "Visualising spatial data and creating maps in R"
subtitle: "Week 3"
output: html_notebook
---
Outline:

In this session, you will be introduced to how to use R to manipulate spatial data (e.g. raster data and polygon data such as shapefiles), the importance of coordinate reference systems (CRSs) and how these data can be used to generate maps.

Essential reading:

TBC

Learning outcomes:

At the end of this section you will be able to use R to:

- Import and manipulate raster and polygon data;
- Change CRSs to ensure your maps accurately represent the spatial data they are showing;
- Create basic maps to show spatial patterns in census and environmental data.
