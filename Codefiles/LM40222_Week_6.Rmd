Outline:

This week we will explore linear regression in R. A fundamental understanding of this is critical for the more complex regression techniques we we explore in the coming weeks. We will cover:

1. Basic theory of linear regression;
2. Its application in R using simple data sets;
3. How to understand the regression coefficient outputs;
4. How to validate the regression models.

Essential Reading:

TBC

Session Aim:

Learning Outcomes:

Using R for lm() function to:

Undertake linear regression in R
Evaluate the summary results table
Use the plot() function to validate the model
